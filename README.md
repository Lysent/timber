## Environment Destruction & Timber

Turns serpulo trees into destructible environment, able to be built over or destroyed. This will result in harvesting timber, a new flammable material which can be used as fuel.

Dependency of the [Etigei Exile](https://github.com/Lysent/etigei-exile) mod as of version 2.1.0 (upcoming update).

**Timber is not currently a dependency of the mods above, but will soon be in an upcoming version.**

## Gameplay Features

#### Environment Destruction

Trees on Serpulo or custom maps (or modded maps) using the vanilla trees (Pine, White Pine, Spore Pine, White Tree, etc) are now destructible. It is now possible to build over trees or destroy them with a right click. This alleviates the infuriating moments where a tree is an unbreakable obstacle in the middle of a prime factory space.

#### Timber

From breaking trees, timber can be harvested. This can be used as fuel for generators using flammable materials. Timber has further uses in the mod [Etigei Exile](https://github.com/Lysent/etigei-exile) as of version 2.1.0.
